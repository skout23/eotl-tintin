# eotl-tintin
some of my tintin related stuff... YMMV
### the mapper
- Load the map
`#map read eotl.map`

- Start the map in the correct room e.g. the 'Loung'
`#map goto 1`

- Check the list of rooms (a bunch don't have names yet sorry)
`#map list`

- Run to a room
`#map run 3` || `#map run {Lounge}`
