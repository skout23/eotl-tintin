some of my tintin related stuff... YMMV
### the mapper
- Load the map:
```
#map read eotl.map
```

- Start the map in the correct room e.g. the "Lounge":
```
#map goto 1
```

- Check the list of rooms (a bunch don't have names yet sorry):
```
#map list
```

- Run to a room:
```
#map run 3
```
OR
```
#map run {Lounge}
```
